# Edunet-Shell Skills4Future AICTE Internship (June - July 2025)
Project - E Waste Generation Classification

Electronic waste (e-waste) is a rapidly growing global concern for both environmental
and public health. Discarded electronic devices contain both valuable resources and
hazardous substances, leading to contamination and health risks if improperly
processed. Manual classification for recycling is labor-intensive, prone to errors, and
inefficient. 

This project aims to establish an automated e-waste classification system
using artificial intelligence and machine learning, enabling accurate and rapid
identification to streamline recycling and promote sustainable waste management.
